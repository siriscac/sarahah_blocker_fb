# Sarahah posts Blocker for Facebook - Chrome and Firefox Extension

Annoyed by all those Sarahah images and links on Facebook? Use this extension to block them all.

## How to install?
1) Download and Extract the Extension bundle from the [releases](https://github.com/siriscac/sarahah_blocker_fb/releases) section
2) Goto the Extensions(chrome://extensions) page for Chrome and (about:debugging) for Firefox
3) Enable Developer mode and then click `Load unpacked extension` button for Chrome. For Firefox, click `Load temporary add-on` and load the manifest.json file. 
4) Load the extracted bundle
5) Now you'll see the extension on the extensions bar, open and click `Block Posts` while on Facebook to block all Sarahah images.
6) `innerPeace = "achieved"`.

## How does it work?
This extension uses [Resemble JS](https://github.com/Huddle/Resemble.js/) library to compare the images on your feed with the reference image under `/ref/base.png` and hides the post that might have a similar one. It also checks if any anchor element that might contain the text "sarahah" in its href and hides the post if it does.

## Disclaimer
This solution was put together in an hour's time and hence, it's not an optimal one. Your facebook tab might get slow or unresponsive occasionally while using this extension - to fix this, simply reload the page and block posts again.
